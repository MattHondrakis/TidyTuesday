# EDA

## Numeric Distribution

```{r}
soccer %>% 
  keep(is.numeric) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~key)
```

## Halftime Leads

```{r}
soccer %>% 
  filter(HTAG != HTHG) %>% 
  mutate(leading = ifelse(HTHG > HTAG, HTHG - HTAG, HTAG - HTHG),
         l_win = ifelse(((HTHG > HTAG) & HTR == "H") | 
                            ((HTAG > HTHG) & HTR == "A"),
                          1,
                          0)) %>% 
  group_by(leading) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            prop = paste0(mean(l_win) * 100, "%")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

All teams that were leading in the half time, won the game by full time.
